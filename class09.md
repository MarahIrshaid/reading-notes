# Chapter 7: “Forms” (p.144-175):
advantages:
1. ADDING TEXT
2. Making Choices
3. Uploading Files
4. Submitting Forms

### How Forms Work:
A user fills in a form and then presses a button
to submit the information to the server.
The name of each form
control is sent to the
server along with the
value the user enters or
selects.
The server processes
the information using a
programming language
such as PHP, C#, VB.net,
or Java. It may also store
the information in a
database.
The server creates a new
page to send back to the
browser based on the
information received.

Whenever you want to c XX ollect information from
visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a
```<form>``` element.
XX Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
XX Each form control is given a name, and the text the
user types in or the values of the options they select
are sent to the server.
XX HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it
easier for visitors to fill in forms.




# Chapter 14: “Lists, Tables & Forms” (pp.330-357):
Lists are indented into the page
by default and the list-styleposition
property indicates
whether the marker should
appear on the inside or the
outside of the box containing the
main points.
This property can take one of
two values:
outside
The marker sits to the left of the
block of text. (This is the default
behaviour if this property is not
used.)
inside
The marker sits inside the box of
text (which is indented).



In addition to the CSS p XX roperties covered in other
chapters which work with the contents of all elements,
there are several others that are specifically used to
control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.
XX List markers can be given different appearances
using the list-style-type and list-style image
properties.
XX Table cells can have different borders and spacing in
different browsers, but there are properties you can
use to control them and make them more consistent.
XX Forms are easier to use if the form controls are
vertically aligned using CSS.
XX Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more
interactive.


you can style every element in the form by using attributes and properties of CSS.


# Chapter 6: “Events” (pp.243-292):

**event handling:**

1. Select t he element
node(s) you want the
script to respond to.


2. Indicate which event on
the selected node(s) will
trigger the response.


3. State the code you want
to run when the event
occurs.
