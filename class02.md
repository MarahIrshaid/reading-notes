# Chapter 2: “Text” (pp.40-61):

1. Headings :
```<h1> ... <h6>```
```<h1>``` is used for main headings
```<h2>``` is used for subheadings

2. paragraphs :
```<p>```
To create a paragraph, surround
the words that make up the
paragraph with an opening ```<p>```
tag and closing ```</p>``` tag.


3. bold and italic :
``` <b>``` for bold text
```<i>``` for italic text


4. 
```<sup>``` for superscript text
```<sub>``` for subscript text.

5. white space 
When the browser comes across
two or more spaces next to each
other, it only displays one space.
Similarly if it comes across a line
break, it treats that as a single
space too. This is known as
white space collapsing.

6. 
```<br />``` for new line break
```<hr />``` for adding  a horizontal rule between sections

#### Semantic Markup:

```<strong>```
for strong text

```<em>```
for bold+italic


```<blockquote>``` 
Browsers tend to indent the
contents of the ```<blockquote>```
element

```<q>```
The ```<q>``` element is used for
shorter quotes that sit within
a paragraph.

```<abbr> </abbr>``` is for showing the full name in a message when hovering at an abbreviation name text.


```<cite>``` for citation

The ```<address>``` element has
quite a specific use: to contain
contact details for the author of
the page.

```<ins>```
```<del>```
The ```<ins>``` element can be used
to show content that has been
inserted into a document, while
the ```<del>``` element can show text
that has been deleted from it.


```<s>```
The ```<s>``` element indicates
something that is no longer
accurate or relevant (but that
should not be deleted).
Visually the content of an ```<s>```
element will usually be displayed
with a line through the center.

# Chapter 10: Ch.10 “Introducing CSS” (pp.226-245):


this is how to apply style to content in CSS
1. style attribute inline styling.
2. style tag in the head
3. style separated page linked to the HTML file using link tag.

``` h1{ attribute:value}```

# Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.53-84):


A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon.

A script will have to temporarily
store the bits of information it
needs to do its job. It can store this
data in variables.

An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values.

var colors;
colors ['white', 'black', ' custom '];
var el document.getElementByld('col ors');
el . textContent = col ors[O];

#### An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions:

1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE
```var color = 'beige';```
 2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE var 
```area = 3 * 2;```

USING ARITHMETIC
OPERATORS just like in any programming language.there is string operators too.


# Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” only up to the section on switch statements (pp.145-162):
