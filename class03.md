**Ordered Lists**
```<ol>```
The ordered list is created with
the ```<ol>``` element.

Each item in the list is placed
between an opening ```<li>``` tag
and a closing ```</li>``` tag. (The li
stands for list item.)

```<ul>```
The unordered list is created
with the ```<ul>``` element.
```<li>```
Each item in the list is placed
between an opening ```<li>``` tag
and a closing ```</li>``` tag. (The li

***Definition Lists***

```<dl>```
The definition list is created with
the ```<dl>``` element and usually
consists of a series of terms and
their definitions.
Inside the ```<dl>``` element you will
usually see pairs of ```<dt>``` and
```<dd>``` elements.
```<dt>```
This is used to contain the term
being defined (the definition
term).
```<dd>```
This is used to contain the
definition.

***Nested Lists***
You can put a second list inside
an ```<li>``` element to create a sublist
or nested list.

extra content that does not fit in
the box.

the box so that users can scroll
to see the missing content.


***border , margin , padding***
border is the lining of the box ,the border
separates the edge of one box
from another.

 Margins sit outside the edge
of the border.

Padding is the space between
the border of a box and any
content contained within it.

**border-width** for adjusting the border size
**border-style** you can set the border to be dotted or solid etc..
**border-color** set the color of the border

The border property allows you
to specify the width, style and
color of a border in one property
(and the values should be coded
in that specific order).

``` border : width style color ;```
```text-align :center; ```


**display**

element to act like an inline
element.

act like a block-level element.

element to flow like an inline
element, while retaining other
features of a block-level element.

The **visibility** property allows
you to hide boxes from users
but It leaves a space where the
element would have been.
This property can take two
values:
**hidden**
This hides the element.
**visible**
This shows the element.

If the visibility of an element
is set to hidden, a blank space
will appear in its place.

The border-image property
applies an image to the border of
any box. It takes a background
image and slices it into nine
pieces.

allows you to add a drop shadow
around a box


3. border-radius :CSS3 introduces the ability to
create rounded corners on any
